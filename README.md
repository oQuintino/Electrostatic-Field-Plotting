# Electric Field Simulation and Visualization of a Coaxial Cylinder with Dielectric Layer

## Overview

This project implements a numerical and analytical model of the electric field generated by a finite-length coaxial cylindrical structure with a dielectric layer, together with a 3D visualization pipeline using PyVista.

The work combines:
- Electromagnetic theory
- Numerical discretization
- Vectorized scientific computing (NumPy)
- 3D scientific visualization (PyVista)

It is intended as an educational and research-oriented tool, demonstrating both physical modeling and clean, modular Python design.

## Physical Problem Description

The system modeled consists of:
- An inner conductor at fixed potential
- A dielectric layer surrounding the inner conductor
- An outer grounded conductor
- A finite cylinder length, introducing edge effects

Unlike the ideal infinite coaxial cable, the finite length causes:
- Axial electric field components
- Deviations from the purely radial analytical solution

The electric field is computed by superposition of finite line charge contributions and corrected inside the dielectric region using permittivity ratios.

- Comparison with finite element solvers
- Export of publication-quality figures

## Author

This project emerges from the study of a Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) case and was developed as part of a learning effort in applied physics and numerical modeling, with emphasis on clarity, correctness, and extensibility
